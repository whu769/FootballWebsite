                I made this website to primarily display fbref information in a more user-friendly format while learning
                web development on the side. Starting out as a bunch of tables, this site gradually began to utilize the 
                data and create visualizations for players, team, and leagues.

                    <li>Tables displaying league, team, and player information from the top 5 European football leagues</li>

                At first I wanted to simply play around with the data tables from fbref and find interesting stats. 
                I wrote a script to obtain information on Europe's top five leagues but had no proper way of displaying the tables.
                As a result, I decided to make a website (and learn how to do that) alongside the fbref information.
                Originally the website was very simple and merely displayed tables of the information. Gradually over time, 
                I began implementing separate tabs and other charts for the information. I created a system to rank a team's weaknesses and 
                strengths which then recommended players to sign accordingly. Additionally, I played around with the Twitter developer API to 
                obtain transfer rumors pertaining to specific players and teams. This in turn made me create a user feature 
                so people could follow various players and teams and get twitter rumors.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future I want to obtain information from the 2021-2022 season and make the website update weekly with new information.
